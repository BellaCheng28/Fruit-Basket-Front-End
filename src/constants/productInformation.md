Dragon Fruit Medley 10.99/lb
Description:
Take your tastebuds to the tropics with succulent dragon fruit. Grown from cactus plants, this fruit is also known as "Queen of the Night," as it only blooms for one night each year. The flesh is dense and sweet, and although it looks exotic, the flavor has familiar notes of kiwi, berry, and watermelon. This gift offers three varieties, starting with white dragon fruit-the most subtle in sweetness with pink skin and white flesh. There is also yellow dragon fruit-the richest with yellow skin and white flesh-and pink dragon fruit, which is the most balanced and features pink skin and pink flesh. These eye-catching delicacies are fantastic on their own and make wonderful additions to breakfasts and desserts.
